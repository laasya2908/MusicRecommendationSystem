# MusicRecommendationSystem
Emotica is a music recommendation system that uses facial emotion recognition to suggest personalized songs by detecting user emotions through OpenCV and Deepface. It relies on a MySQL database to recommend songs based on language preferences and redirects users to their browser for the selected track.
